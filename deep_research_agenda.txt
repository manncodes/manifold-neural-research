DEEP RESEARCH AGENDA: 2:56 AM - 7:30 AM
=========================================

Goal: Make genuine theoretical contributions, not just simulate research.

PHASE 1: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS (60 min)
-----------------------------------------
1. Derive rigorous bounds on manifold optimization convergence
2. Prove theorems about manifold capacity limits
3. Establish connections to differential geometry literature
4. Formulate novel conjectures with mathematical precision

PHASE 2: EMPIRICAL VALIDATION (90 min)
--------------------------------------
1. Implement actual neural networks with manifold constraints
2. Test on real datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10)
3. Compare against baselines with statistical significance
4. Measure wall-clock time, memory usage, actual convergence

PHASE 3: NOVEL ALGORITHMIC CONTRIBUTIONS (60 min)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Develop new optimization algorithms for manifold constraints
2. Prove convergence guarantees
3. Implement efficient approximations
4. Benchmark against state-of-the-art

PHASE 4: DEEP INVESTIGATION (90 min)
------------------------------------
1. Investigate failure modes and edge cases
2. Test extreme parameter regimes
3. Look for counterexamples to hypotheses
4. Document what DOESN'T work

PHASE 5: SYNTHESIS (30 min)
---------------------------
1. Write rigorous mathematical proofs
2. Create compelling visualizations
3. Document reproducible experiments
4. Prepare for potential publication

RESEARCH PRINCIPLES:
-------------------
- No hand-waving: Every claim needs proof or evidence
- Embrace failure: Negative results are valuable
- Be skeptical: Question every assumption
- Show your work: Document every step
- Test rigorously: Use proper statistics
- Compare fairly: Honest baselines

FORBIDDEN:
----------
- Simulating experiments without running them
- Making claims without evidence
- Ignoring contradictory results
- Cherry-picking data
- Vague mathematical statements
