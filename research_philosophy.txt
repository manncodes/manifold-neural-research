RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY: MANIFOLD CONSTRAINTS IN NEURAL NETWORKS
==============================================================

Core Principles (Extracted from Thinking Machines Approach):
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. THEORETICAL RIGOR WITH PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Start with mathematical foundations
   - Build intuition through geometric interpretation
   - Validate through systematic experimentation
   - Acknowledge computational tradeoffs

2. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN EXPLORATION
   - Form clear, testable hypotheses
   - Design experiments that isolate variables
   - Measure both expected and unexpected outcomes
   - Question conventional wisdom

3. INCREMENTAL COMPLEXITY
   - Begin with simple, provable cases (hypersphere)
   - Gradually increase sophistication (Stiefel manifolds)
   - Build modular components that compose

4. TRANSPARENT METHODOLOGY
   - Document every design decision
   - Show failures alongside successes
   - Provide reproducible code
   - Explain mathematical intuitions clearly

Research Questions to Pursue:
------------------------------

PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS:
Can we discover new manifold constraints that provide better inductive biases
for specific problem domains?

SUB-HYPOTHESES:
1. Do different manifold constraints lead to predictable convergence patterns?
2. Can we compose multiple manifold constraints hierarchically?
3. Is there a relationship between manifold curvature and generalization?
4. Do certain architectures naturally "prefer" specific manifolds?
5. Can we derive optimal manifolds from data characteristics?

Experimental Framework:
-----------------------

Phase 1: Foundational Understanding
- Implement core manifold optimization algorithms
- Reproduce known results as validation
- Build measurement infrastructure

Phase 2: Systematic Exploration
- Test manifold constraints across different:
  * Network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers)
  * Data modalities (vision, text, synthetic)
  * Task types (classification, regression, generation)
- Track comprehensive metrics

Phase 3: Novel Discovery
- Propose new manifold families
- Derive theoretical properties
- Empirically validate advantages

Phase 4: Law Formation
- Identify consistent patterns
- Formulate mathematical relationships
- Test predictive power

Measurement Strategy:
--------------------

Core Metrics:
- Optimization trajectory (loss landscape navigation)
- Spectral properties evolution
- Gradient flow characteristics
- Generalization gap dynamics
- Computational overhead

Novel Metrics to Develop:
- Manifold adherence score
- Geometric consistency measure
- Compositional efficiency ratio
- Information-theoretic manifold capacity

Scientific Method:
-----------------

1. OBSERVE: Track all phenomena, expected and unexpected
2. HYPOTHESIZE: Form concrete, mathematical predictions
3. EXPERIMENT: Design controlled tests with clear variables
4. ANALYZE: Apply rigorous statistical and geometric analysis
5. THEORIZE: Derive general principles from specific results
6. VALIDATE: Test theories on unseen problems

Key Insights from Thinking Machines:
