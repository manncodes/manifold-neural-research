# Practitioner Guidelines: Manifold-Constrained Neural Networks

**Purpose**: Actionable recommendations based on 200+ experimental runs

**Target Audience**: ML engineers, researchers, practitioners considering manifold constraints

## Executive Decision Framework

### Should I Use Manifold Constraints?

**Start here:** Ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Does my problem have verifiable geometric structure?**
   - Examples: 3D rotation matrices (SO(3)), orthogonal projections, unit norm vectors
   - Counter-examples: General classification, regression, standard NLP/CV tasks
   - **If NO → Use unconstrained networks**

2. **Am I solving a specific pathology that ONLY manifolds can fix?**
   - Examples: Gradient explosion in GANs (spectral norm), preserving physical constraints
   - Check: Have I tried simpler solutions (gradient clipping, batch norm, careful initialization)?
   - **If simpler solutions work → Use those instead**

3. **Can I afford 10-300x computational overhead?**
   - Our measurements: 111x slower (Stiefel at 512×256), 291x slower (SpectralNorm)
   - Wall-clock time matters more than iteration count
   - **If NO → Don't use manifolds**

**Decision Rule**:
```
IF (geometric_structure == TRUE) AND
   (simpler_solutions_failed == TRUE) AND
   (can_afford_overhead == TRUE)
THEN consider_manifolds()
ELSE use_unconstrained()
```

## When Manifolds Help (Rare Cases)

### 1. True Geometric Structure

**Use Case**: 3D pose estimation, rotation prediction

**Why It Works**: Problem naturally lives on SO(3) manifold

**Example**:
```python
# Predicting 3D rotations
class RotationPredictor(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        R = self.network(x)  # Output: 3x3 matrix
        R = project_to_SO3(R)  # Enforce R^T R = I, det(R) = 1
        return R
```

**Expected Benefit**: 2-5% accuracy improvement, guaranteed valid rotations

**Cost**: 2-10x slower training

### 2. GAN Training Stability

**Use Case**: Discriminator spectral normalization

**Why It Works**: Bounds Lipschitz constant → prevents mode collapse

**Example**:
```python
# Spectral normalization in discriminator
class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.fc1 = SpectralNorm(nn.Linear(784, 256))
        self.fc2 = SpectralNorm(nn.Linear(256, 1))
```

**Expected Benefit**: More stable training, fewer mode collapses

**Cost**: 1.5-8x slower per iteration

**Alternative**: Try gradient penalty first (simpler, often works)

### 3. Physics-Informed Neural Networks

**Use Case**: Enforcing conservation laws (energy, momentum)

**Why It Works**: Physical constraints often manifolds (symplectic, unitary)

**Example**:
```python
# Hamiltonian system preserving energy
class HamiltonianNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = [SymplecticLayer(dim) for _ in range(depth)]
```

**Expected Benefit**: Better physical consistency, fewer unphysical predictions

**Cost**: Depends on manifold complexity

## When Manifolds DON'T Help (Common Cases)

### 1. Standard Classification

**Problem**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet classification

**Our Finding**: Manifolds HURT performance
- MNIST: Unconstrained 96.39%, Stiefel 95.00% (-1.39%)
- Grassmann: -1.11%, Product: -4.17%

**Reason**: No geometric structure in label space

**Recommendation**: **Use standard CNNs/ResNets**

### 2. Limited Data Scenarios

**Hypothesis**: Manifolds provide better inductive bias with few samples

**Our Finding**: **HYPOTHESIS REJECTED**
- Tested n ∈ {50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1797}
- Stiefel win rate: 0/6 (lost or tied at every sample size)
- Unconstrained won even with 50 samples

**Reason**: Manifold constraints reduce capacity more than they regularize

**Recommendation**: Use data augmentation, transfer learning, or simple regularization (dropout, L2) instead

### 3. Standard NLP/Seq2Seq

**Problem**: Language modeling, machine translation

**Reason**: Text doesn't have geometric manifold structure

**Recommendation**: Use transformers, careful initialization, proper normalization layers

---

## Hyperparameter Guidelines

Based on our ablation studies:

### Learning Rate

**Finding**: Manifolds MORE sensitive to learning rate (55% higher variance)

**Recommendations**:
- Start with **lower learning rate** than unconstrained
- If unconstrained uses lr=0.01, try lr=0.005 for Stiefel
- Use learning rate finder or grid search
- Monitor early training closely

**Typical ranges**:
- Unconstrained: 0.001 - 0.1
- Stiefel: 0.0005 - 0.05
- SpectralNorm: 0.001 - 0.01

### Batch Size

**Finding**: Similar sensitivity to batch size

**Recommendations**:
- Small batches (8-32) work best for both
- Larger batches (>128) hurt both methods
- No relative advantage for manifolds
- Stick to standard batch size recommendations

### Initialization

**Finding**: Similar sensitivity (coefficient of variation ~0.004-0.005)

**Recommendations**:
- Use standard initialization (Xavier, He)
- For Stiefel: Initialize with QR decomposition of random matrix
- For SpectralNorm: Initialize with small values (scale by 0.1)
- Run multiple seeds for important applications

## Computational Budget Planning

### Time Overhead

Based on precise profiling:

| Layer Size | Stiefel Overhead | SpectralNorm Overhead |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 64×32 (small) | 20x | 76x |
| 128×64 (medium) | 30x | 177x |
| 256×128 (large) | 37x | 97x |
| 512×256 (xlarge) | **111x** | **291x** |

**Key Insight**: Overhead GROWS with layer size

**Planning Formula**:
```
manifold_training_time = unconstrained_time × overhead_factor
```

**Example**:
- Unconstrained training: 1 hour
- Stiefel training (256×128 layers): 37 hours
- **Budget accordingly!**

### Memory Overhead

- Stiefel: ~3x memory (stores Q, R matrices)
- SpectralNorm: ~5x memory (stores U, s, Vh)
- Grassmann: ~3x memory (similar to Stiefel)

**Practical Tip**: If you run out of GPU memory, reduce batch size by overhead factor

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Periodic Projection** (Future Work):
   - Project every k=5-10 steps instead of every step
   - Expected: 5-10x speedup with <1% accuracy loss
   - Requires custom training loop

2. **Approximate Projections**:
   - Cayley transform: O(np) vs O(np²) for QR
   - Iterative power method for spectral norm
   - Trade-off: Approximation error vs speed

3. **Mixed Precision**:
   - Use FP16 for forward/backward, FP32 for projections
   - Can reduce memory, slight speedup
   - Be careful with numerical stability

## Debugging Manifold Training

### Common Issues

#### 1. Loss Not Decreasing

**Symptoms**: Loss stuck or increasing

**Likely Cause**: Learning rate too high for manifold geometry

**Solutions**:
- Reduce learning rate by 2-5x
- Check gradient norms (should be <10)
- Verify projection is working (check constraint satisfaction)

**Debug Code**:
```python
# Check if projection maintains constraint
def check_stiefel_constraint(W):
    WtW = W.T @ W
    I = np.eye(W.shape[1])
    error = np.linalg.norm(WtW - I, 'fro')
    print(f"Constraint error: {error:.6f}")  # Should be < 1e-6
```

#### 2. Training Much Slower Than Expected

**Symptoms**: Takes 10x longer than estimated

**Likely Cause**: Projection overhead, small batch size, or inefficient implementation

**Solutions**:
- Profile with cProfile to find bottleneck
- Check if using optimized BLAS/LAPACK
- Consider larger batch size (if memory allows)
- Implement periodic projection

#### 3. High Variance Across Runs

**Symptoms**: Different seeds give wildly different results

**Likely Cause**: Sensitivity to initialization or learning rate

**Solutions**:
- Run 5+ seeds, report mean ± std
- Use learning rate warmup
- Try smaller learning rate
- Check if problem is inherently hard

## Alternative Approaches (Try These First!)

Before using manifold constraints, try these simpler solutions:

### 1. Better Initialization

- Xavier initialization: `W ~ N(0, 2/(n_in + n_out))`
- He initialization: `W ~ N(0, 2/n_in)`
- Orthogonal initialization: `W = QR(randn(n,p))[0]`

**Cost**: Free
**Expected Benefit**: 1-3% accuracy improvement

### 2. Normalization Layers

- Batch Normalization
- Layer Normalization
- Instance Normalization

**Cost**: 10-20% overhead
**Expected Benefit**: Faster convergence, better generalization

### 3. Standard Regularization

- Dropout (p=0.1-0.5)
- L2 regularization (weight decay)
- Early stopping

**Cost**: Negligible
**Expected Benefit**: 2-5% improvement with limited data

### 4. Data Augmentation

- Rotation, flip, crop (images)
- Back-translation (text)
- Mixup, CutMix

**Cost**: 20-50% overhead
**Expected Benefit**: 5-15% improvement with limited data

**Our Recommendation**: Try ALL of these before manifolds!

## Metrics to Track

When experimenting with manifolds, monitor:

1. **Test Accuracy**: Primary metric
2. **Training Time**: Wall-clock hours, not just iterations
3. **Generalization Gap**: Train - Test accuracy
4. **Constraint Satisfaction**: ||W^T W - I||_F for Stiefel
5. **Gradient Norms**: Should be stable
6. **Loss Trajectory**: Compare convergence speed
7. **Memory Usage**: Peak GPU memory
8. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Run multiple LRs

**Report Template**:
```
Method: [Unconstrained/Stiefel/SpectralNorm]
Test Accuracy: [value ± std over 5 seeds]
Training Time: [hours]
Time Overhead: [X times unconstrained]
Memory Overhead: [X times unconstrained]
Learning Rate Used: [value]
Generalization Gap: [train - test]
```

## Final Recommendation

Based on 200+ experiments across 5 manifold types, 6 sample sizes, and multiple hyperparameter configurations:

**DEFAULT TO UNCONSTRAINED NETWORKS**

Manifold constraints are specialized tools for specific problems with geometric structure. For 95% of applications, standard unconstrained networks with proper:
- Initialization
- Normalization
- Regularization
- Data augmentation

...will outperform manifold-constrained networks at a fraction of the computational cost.

**When in doubt, choose simplicity.**
